# ðŸš€ Quick Start (Skip Lean Verification)
If you want to test the AI logic immediately without waiting for full Lean setup:
```bash
cd lab2-starter-code/
```
# Skip Lean verification during development
```bash
export SKIP_LEAN_VERIFICATION=true

# Run tests (will work without Lean installed)
```bash
make test
Add to your shell profile for persistence:
bash# For bash users
echo 'export SKIP_LEAN_VERIFICATION=true' >> ~/.bashrc
source ~/.bashrc
```

# For zsh users  
```bash
echo 'export SKIP_LEAN_VERIFICATION=true' >> ~/.zshrc
source ~/.zshrc
```
