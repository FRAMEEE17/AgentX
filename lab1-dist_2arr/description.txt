-----Description----- 
This task requires writing a Lean 4 method that calculates the distance value between two integer arrays. The distance value is defined as the number of elements in arr1[i] such that there is no element arr2[j] where the absolute difference |arr1[i] - arr2[j]| is less than or equal to d. In other words, count elements in arr1 that are "far enough" from all elements in arr2.

-----Input-----
The input consists of three parameters:
arr1: An array of integers (the reference array).
arr2: An array of integers (the comparison array).
d: A natural number representing the distance threshold.

-----Output-----
The output is a natural number:
Returns the count of elements in arr1 such that for each element, all elements in arr2 are at a distance greater than d.
